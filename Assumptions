The following assumptions are being taken while developing the application:

1. The registration number of all car will be of same length and will be of form 'PB-01-HH-1234'.
2. All cars will have distinct unique registration number.
3. For all the cases, like giving 2 commands for creating parking lot, parking car when lot is full
   will have custom message output.
4. The commands format are never wrong, they are expected as shown in the example input file, anything else will
   give raise to wrong command output.
5. Driver age will always be a valid integer.
